## Playground_UniRep
1. _Evotuning (UniRep).ipynb based on [UniRep](https://github.com/churchlab/UniRep-analysis): 1900-unit mLSTM (and|or) a basic feed-forward network as a top model by regression with MSE loss and the Adam optimizer; data formatting, babbling (shuffling) the sequences + babbling the sequence with a short seed sequence
2. levenshtein.ipynb: multidimensional scaling of the Levenshtein  distance of 9 GPCRs
3. t-SNE.ipynb: UniRep representations within organisms based on [UniRep-analysis](https://github.com/churchlab/UniRep-analysis/blob/master/figures/figure2/fig2b_supp_fig2_upper.ipynb)
